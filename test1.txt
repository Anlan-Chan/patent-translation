Titanium-based photocatalyst doped with niobium and vanadium and preparation method and application thereof

The present invention discloses a titanium-based photocatalyst doped with niobium and vanadium, a preparation 
method and an application thereof, and belongs to the field of inorganic photocatalytic materials.

According to a stoichiometric ratio of TiTa<sub>18 <i>x y</i></sub>Nb<sub><i>x</i></sub>V<sub><i>y</i></sub>O<sub>47</sub>, 
wherein <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the molar amounts of niobium Nb<sup>5+</sup> vanadium V<sup>5+</sup> ions replacees Ta, 
respectively. <i>x</i> is 0.1～5.4,<i>y</i> is 0.1～2，weigh raw materials containing Ti<sup>4+</sup>, Nb<sup>5+</sup>,
 Ta<sup>5+</sup> and V<sup>5+</sup> ions，and weigh a proper amount of the compound containing Li<sup>+</sup> ion as a 
 sintering aid. 
 
 A step-by-step sintering process is employed to obtain a titanium-based photocatalyst which is doped with niobium and 
 vanadium in a pure phase. The titanium-based photocatalyst obtained by doping niobium Nb and vanadium V enhances the 
 absorption in the visible light region. At the same time, the lattice perturbation greatly improves the separation efficiency 
 of photogenerated charges and enhances the photocatalytic ability.

 
The preparation process is simple, the cost is low, and the photocatalytic material has good stability. It can degrade organic pollutants under ultraviolet light and near-ultraviolet light, especially degrade organic pollutants in water, which is beneficial to protect the environment.
